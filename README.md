Robust INner and Outer Approximated Reachability

This is a verification tool that computes inner and outer approximations of reachable sets for uncertain continous-time dynamical systems with perturbations and control inputs. It implements the method described in 
[Inner and Outer Reachability for the Verification of Control Systems, Proceedings of HSCC 2019]

Early version available from http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Sylvie.Putot/software.html, cleaner version coming soon on this repository.
